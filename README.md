# Trivia-App TESTER and TYPESCRIPT

## Labb 2: TypeScript och Cypress Testing

### Ursula Vallejo Janne | November 2024

### üìã Project Summary

This project is a **fullstack Trivia web application** developed as part of the course requirements.
The app allows users to explore trivia questions, create new ones, update them, and delete them ‚Äî supporting a complete CRUD workflow.

The application consists of:

- **Frontend** built with React and TypeScript (using TSX)
- **Backend** implemented with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript
- **PostgreSQL database** for persistent storage of trivia questions
- **End-to-End (E2E) and component tests** implemented with Cypress and TypeScript

Key features:

- Display a list of trivia questions with answers
- Add new questions through a user-friendly form
- Edit and delete existing questions
- Responsive UI, compatible with both desktop and mobile devices
- Error handling for API calls
- Automated tests covering frontend, backend, and database

Testing:

- Full E2E tests for user interaction and complete flow verification (frontend + backend + database)
- Component tests verifying UI behavior with mock data
- Integration tests verifying direct API behavior
- Use of Cypress Fixtures for mocking API responses
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) applied to selected components
- Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) applied with Given-When-Then approach in specific tests
- UML diagrams created to describe key parts of the project architecture
- Code coverage measured and reported
- Automated test execution with GitHub Actions on each `git push`

The project was built entirely with **TypeScript** ‚Äî no JavaScript/JSX used.
Special focus was given to test coverage and testing best practices.

This project fulfills both the **functional** and **testing** requirements for the course, with advanced coverage and automation in place.
